# üìã Repeat Quran MVP ‚Äî Units of Human Work (Final Engineer-Ready)

> Rule: Each UHW ‚â§ 90 minutes, independently verifiable.  
> Proof required: screenshot, demo video, APK, or log evidence.  
> Decisions: Nested sequential multi-reciter, lazy-fetch-next playback, internal caching, dynamic streaks, retry-once error handling, APK sideload release, light + dark themes, motivational streak banner.
