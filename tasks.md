# üìã Repeat Quran MVP ‚Äî Units of Human Work (Final Engineer-Ready)

> Rule: Each UHW ‚â§ 90 minutes, independently verifiable.  
> Proof required: screenshot, demo video, APK, or log evidence.  
> Decisions: Nested sequential multi-reciter, lazy-fetch-next playback, internal caching, dynamic streaks, retry-once error handling, APK sideload release, light + dark themes, motivational streak banner.

  - **Proof**: Screenshot of Home with history list.  
  - **QA Note**: Verify DB has all sessions.  

- [ ] **UHW-13: Streak Counter (Encouragement Banner)**  
  - Compute streaks dynamically from logs.  
  - Banner = ‚Äúüî• X-day streak ‚Äî keep going!‚Äù

  - Save verse files in internal storage.  
  - **Proof**: Device file explorer screenshot.  

- [ ] **UHW-15: Downloads Tab**  
  - ‚úÖ if all verses cached, else ‚¨áÔ∏è.

- [ ] **UHW-16: Offline Playback (With Online Fallback)**  
  - If not cached ‚Üí fetch online; if offline ‚Üí error message.  
  - **Proof**: Demo video in airplane mode.  

---

## Phase 7: Resume & Error Handling
- [ ] **UHW-17: Session Resume (Exact Position)**  
  - Save ExoPlayer millisecond state.  
  - **Proof**: Demo video showing resume mid-verse.  

- [ ] **UHW-18: Error Handling (Retry Once + Actionable)**  
  - Retry failed verse once. Show ‚ÄúRetry / Skip‚Äù if still failing.  
  - **Proof**: Manual test log.  

---

## Phase 8: QA Harness
- [ ] **UHW-19: Unit Tests (Core + Edge Cases)**  
  - Test repeat logic, reciter queue, history DB, caching reuse, resume state, error retry.  
  - **Proof**: CI test log screenshot.  

- [ ] **UHW-20: Stress Test Playback**  
  - Simulate pause/resume, switch reciters mid-play, call interruption.  
  - **Proof**: Manual test log.  

---

## Phase 9: Onboarding & Analytics
