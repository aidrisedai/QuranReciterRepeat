  - Proof: One-button control works regardless of state.

- [x] **UHW-PR-16: Controls Row Simplification (One Toggle)**  
  - Controls row uses a single Pause/Resume toggle (sends ACTION_TOGGLE); toolbar toggle mirrors it.  
  - Proof: Both toggles stay in sync.

- [x] **UHW-PR-17: Tab Play Consistency**  
  - Ensure Play on all tabs only loads/starts selection (no implicit toggle).  
  - Proof: Play never pauses; only builds and starts.

- [ ] **UHW-PR-18: UI Binding and Enablement**  
  - Bind toggles solely to broadcast extras (hasQueue, playing); ensure initial enable on first enqueue.  
  - Proof: Toggle enabled after first Play; updates on Pause/Resume.
