Proof checklist for UHW-UI-13: Surah Labels (Verse/Range/Settings)

Capture the following screenshots and place them in this folder:

- verse-dropdown.png — Verse tab surah dropdown open showing items like "001 — Al-Fatihah".
- range-start-dropdown.png — Range tab start surah dropdown open with names.
- range-end-dropdown.png — Range tab end surah dropdown open with names.
- settings-surah-dropdown.png — Settings → Downloads surah dropdown open with names.

Optional: A short clip confirming selection still plays/works as before.

Notes:
- Parsing remains based on the first three digits of the label.
- No changes to playback logic; display-only enhancement.
