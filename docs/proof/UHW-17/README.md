UHW-17 — Session Resume (Exact Position) Proof

What to capture
- Demo video showing resuming mid-ayah for: single verse, range, page, and surah.

Steps
1) Start playback for a case (e.g., Page 1). Let it play a few seconds into an ayah.
2) Kill the app and relaunch.
3) Tap the “Resume” button on Home. Playback should continue at the exact millisecond in the correct ayah.
4) Repeat for single, range, and surah.

Notes
- Resume uses saved reciters and repeat mode at time of starting the session.
- If offline: cached items resume; uncached items skip per UHW-16 behavior.
