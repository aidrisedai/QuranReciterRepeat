UHW-UI-11 â€” Visual QA + RTL/Arabic Proof

What to capture
- RTL screenshots of the app showing the new theme, top bar, tabs, pills, and a focused tab.

Steps
1) Enable RTL in Developer Options (Force RTL layout direction) and/or set device language to Arabic.
2) Launch the app and capture screenshots of the Home with tabs and one focused tab (e.g., Verse or Range).
3) Save images to this folder.

Notes
- Arabic strings added for key labels (app name, section titles, split-halves label) under `values-ar/`.
- Layouts use start/end constraints to support RTL.
