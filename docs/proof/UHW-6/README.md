Please add the following here:

- controls-emulator.png — Emulator screenshot showing Play, Pause, Next, Prev
- controls-device.png — Physical device screenshot with the same controls
- optional: controls-darkmode.png — Screenshot in dark mode to confirm DayNight consistency

Test checklist:
1) Launch app; confirm controls visible and usable.
2) Tap Play → audio starts; Pause → audio pauses.
3) Next/Prev move between tracks (watch notification title or logs).
4) Toggle device dark mode; verify controls remain legible.
