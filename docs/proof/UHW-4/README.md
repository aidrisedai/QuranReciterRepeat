Proof Artifacts — UHW-4: ExoPlayer Integration (Lazy-Fetch-Next)

Please add the following here:

- playback-demo.mp4 — Screen recording showing continuous playback with no gaps on weak Wi‑Fi
- logcat.txt — Logcat export highlighting buffer appends and no underruns

How to capture:
1) Ensure device/emulator has Internet.
2) Launch app; playback auto-starts with demo URLs. Replace with real Quran URLs if desired.
3) Record screen for ~30–60 seconds showing seamless transitions between tracks.
4) Export Logcat filtered by tag: MainActivity|PlaybackManager and save as logcat.txt.
